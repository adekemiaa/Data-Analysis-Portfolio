### Project Overview
---
The Data Analysis projects aims to generate insight into the sales performance of the E commerce project over the past years. By analyzing the various parameter in the data received we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data.

### Data Sources

In the initial phase of Data Cleaning and preparations, we perform the following
